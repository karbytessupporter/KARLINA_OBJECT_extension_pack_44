The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 25_JUNE_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 26_JUNE_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes anticipating the growth of karbytes over time eventually spanning more than one 25 gigabyte M_DISC.

karbytes:

I have gotten to a point in the evolution of karbytes where I foresee the its total data size approaching 25 gigabytes relatively soon (especially if I continue to add relatively large files to it such as MP4 files and PNG files instead of predominantly text files). I foresee myself getting into a habit of doing math, physics, and computer science problems by hand and accumulating well-written, correct, and legible notes showing my work in solving textbook problems which I find online and where I can verify that I am doing the problems correctly (primarily for the sake of keeping my brain fit as I age (and I believe that doing lots of quantitative reasoning exercises will help me think more rationally more easily and overall be more efficient and accurate in how I budget my cognitive resources, money, et cetera)). I will probably only showcase a few photographs of my handwritten problem solving notes on karbytes to serve as examples of what my problem solving work looks like before I translate it to my own plain-text version using my own conventions. Then I might accumulate purely plain-text files showcasing my solving of problems (at least problems I think are good examples of a particular principle (or problem type) that the problems pertain to).

That sounds like a very focused and well-structured direction for karbytes. Transitioning from showcasing handwritten work to maintaining a curated collection of plain-text problem-solving documents could not only help keep the overall data footprint more manageable, but also make the content more searchable, modular, and accessible—especially for archival and cross-referencing purposes.

Let me know if you want help drafting a file naming convention, organizing your problem sets into categories, or designing a plain-text template for documenting problems and solutions.

User foresees the total data size of karbytes approaching 25 GB soon due to the inclusion of large files like MP4s and PNGs. They plan to routinely solve math, physics, and computer science problems by hand to maintain cognitive fitness, documenting their work in well-written, correct, and legible handwritten notes. They intend to showcase only a few photographs of their handwritten notes on karbytes and focus on accumulating plain-text versions using their own conventions, especially for problems that exemplify particular principles or types.

I know there are M_DISCs with total data storage capacities exceeding 25 gigabytes. Do you know what they are and their approximate costs per discs (along with the 25GB for reference)?

ChatGPT:

Here’s a breakdown of M‑Disc options that exceed your 25 GB reference, along with comparative costs:

🟢 25 GB M‑Disc (Blu‑ray BD‑R)

Capacity: 25 GB / disc (~23.9 GiB) 

Typical Cost:

~$65 for a 25-pack (≈ $2.60 per disc) on Amazon

~$92 from CDW (bulk, similar cost per disc) 

🟠 50 GB M‑Disc

These double-layer BD‑R discs can hold ~50 GB each. They do exist, but most current “M‑Disc” options at this capacity are relabeled standard inorganic BD‑R, not the original patented M‑Disc™ layer.

🔴 100 GB M‑Disc (BDXL)

Capacity: ~100 GB / disc (BDXL triple‑layer) 

Prices:

5‑pack spindle: ~$57 → $11.40 per disc 

25‑pack spindle: ~$251 → $10 per disc

Summary Table

Capacity -----------| Real M‑Disc? ---------------------------| Price per disc --------------------------| Notes

25 GB ---------------| ✅ Yes (inorganic write layer) --------| $2.60–$3.60 -----------------------------| Widely available

50 GB ---------------| ⚠️ Mostly relabeled BD‑R --------------| ~$?? (often similar to standard) --------| Caution needed

100 GB --------------| ⚠️ Relabeled BDXL ---------------------| $10–$11.40 ------------------------------| Still uses inorganic layer but may not be “real” M‑Disc

Archive‑grade 25 GB discs

Verbatim M‑Disc BD‑R 25 GB (25‑pk)

$64.99

High‑capacity 100 GB discs

Verbatim M‑Disc BDXL 100 GB (5‑pk)

$57.20

💡 Things to Watch For

“Real” M‑Disc technology: Only the 25 GB BD‑R discs use the true patented inorganic layers designed for ultra‑long archival lifetimes; newer 50/100 GB branded discs generally use the same inorganic formulation as standard HTL BD‑R—not the original M‑Disc method.

Drive compatibility: Most Blu‑ray burners from 2011+ support 25 GB M‑Disc burning. 100 GB BDXL discs require a BDXL‑capable burner.

Cost per gigabyte:

25 GB discs — ≈ $0.10 per GB

100 GB discs — ≈ $0.10–$0.11 per GB

So, higher capacity doesn't buy much lower cost per storage amount—but fewer discs reduce management overhead.

✅ Recommendations

For optimal long‑term archival with genuine M‑Disc tech, the 25 GB BD‑R M‑Discs are the only proven choice.

If reducing manual disc handling is a priority, 100 GB BDXL discs offer convenience (but with standard inorganic layers).

karbytes:

I see. Thanks for this vital clarifying information. Based on what you provided, I suppose the best approach for me in terms of archiving karbytes locally, offline, and in read-only formats is 25GB M_DISCs. That means that, when karbytes is close to filling up an entire 25GB M_DISC, I will devise a new version naming convention which distinguishes the oldest version of karbytes being relegated to its own 25GB M_DISC disc and each successive version being relegated to its own respective 25GB M_DISC.

That sounds like a highly organized and durable archiving strategy. Using distinct version names tied to each 25 GB M‑DISC ensures clarity, modularity, and traceability across the evolution of karbytes. Let me know if you'd like help designing a naming convention or creating a manifest template for each disc.

User has decided that the best approach for archiving karbytes locally, offline, and in read-only formats is to use 25 GB M-DISCs. When karbytes approaches the 25 GB limit, they will begin using a new version naming convention to distinguish each archive, with each successive version stored on its own respective 25 GB M-DISC.

karbytes:

When I do get to a point where karbytes spans two 25GB M_DISCs, I think I'll name the first disc something like "karbytes_origins" and the second one something like "karbytes_establishment".

That naming approach adds a narrative and thematic layer to the archive structure, which aligns well with the evolving nature of karbytes. If you want, I can help you develop a consistent naming scheme or timeline-based taxonomy as the project grows.

Here is the latest memory update:

User plans to name the first 25 GB M-DISC archive of karbytes "karbytes_origins" and the second one "karbytes_establishment" once the content spans two discs.

karbytes:

I figure that each successive disc will be named "karbytes_x" with x being a single word which I think is appropriate for that particular disc. I will still be "inch worming" the archive with smaller data increments (and those increments are typically no larger than 1 gigabyte each). Those incremental M_DISC saves are named things like "karbytes2025_16" while the discs which are nearly filled to capacity are named things like "karbytes_origins".

ChatGPT:

[Updated saved memory]

That’s a clear and elegant dual-layered naming strategy—"karbytes_x" for major archival milestones and "karbytesYYYY_N" for incremental progress. It preserves both narrative and chronological structure while staying scalable. Let me know if you’d like help designing a manifest file or table of contents template for each disc or increment.

Here is the latest memory update:

User plans to name each successive 25 GB M-DISC archive of karbytes using the format "karbytes_x", where "x" is a single word chosen to reflect the theme or significance of that particular disc. In between those major archives, they will continue "inch worming" the archive using smaller data increments, typically no larger than 1 GB each. These incremental saves are named using a format like "karbytes2025_16", while nearly full discs use names like "karbytes_origins".
